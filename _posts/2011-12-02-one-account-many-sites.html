<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Oh, "Please sign in", I'm fed-up with signing in on various websites. This should be easier. Log on once and work anywhere. That sound is like to write once run anywhere. It is very familiar if you are a Java programmer.<br /><br />Log-in wastes time and waste data. How nice if we can log on one time and work with many sites without logging again. The browser should create a special session for that. Signing out should be the same. If you once sign out browser should abandon the session completely.<br /><br />I think this will not easy at first. But Remember Me is not a good option for people who haven't a personal computer. If somebody can log on once and work many sites it is an advantage</div>
