I am writing this post as a note to myself. Every time I want to find slow running queries, I search and open this <a href="https://medium.com/little-programming-joys/finding-and-killing-long-running-queries-on-postgres-7c4f0449e86d" target="_blank">medium post</a>. It is a well written short post which helps me every day. But I wanted to improve that query.   <script src="https://gist.github.com/dedunumax/a0542b83d4d672eabbf7a17a8ed9dac3.js"></script> As mentioned these are pretty helpful too.<br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">SELECT pg_cancel_backend(pid);&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid);</span>
