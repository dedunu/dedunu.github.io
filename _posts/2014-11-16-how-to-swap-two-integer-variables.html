<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="text-align: justify;">Well. We can swap two integer variables using third variables. That is not a problem. Let's say we want to swap two variables without using a third variable. For that, you can use simple mathematical operations such as addition/subtraction. But division multiplication will introduce an error to the data for example if you have to swap 1 and 3. Using subtraction and addition, you can swap two variables without affecting their values.&nbsp; </div><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/dedunumax/c95642c22ed52fdc4cbb.js"></script></div>
