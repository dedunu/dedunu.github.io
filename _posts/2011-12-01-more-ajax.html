<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Internet should be smoother. And in that case, every website should use AJAX as much as possible. Do you know how much I hate to refresh when I was using Dial-Up connection?<br /><br />Using AJAX will reduce data transmission. And It will attract more users. But AJAX is not the only solution to this. We should make the internet a better place. Internet browsers compatibility on HTML5 will help this too.<br /><br />HTML5's video player will reduce using Flash Player. Then we wouldn't need Flash plugins anymore! Thank you HTML5!</div>
