I couldn't write anything down for a while. I had to move a table from one schema to another in Postgres. I had to do this on RDS. pg_dump and pg_restore tools doesn't allow you to change schema when you dump and restore.<br /><br />The easiest way is running below command:<br /><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">ALTER TABLE old_schema.table_you_want_to_move SET SCHEMA new_schema;</span>
