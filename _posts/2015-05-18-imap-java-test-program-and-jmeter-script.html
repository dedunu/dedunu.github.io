<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">One of my colleagues wanted to write a JMeter script to test IMAP. But that code failed. So I also got involved in that. JMeter BeanShell uses Java in the backend. First I tried with a Maven project. Finally, I could write code to list the IMAP folders. Java implementation is shown below. <br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/dedunumax/a5c5498bfefe64b0bbe4.js"></script> Then we wrote a code to print IMAP folder count for JMeter BeanShell. Code is shown below. <br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/dedunumax/13cbacfbdf60c7692b64.js"></script> Complete Maven project is available on GitHub - <a href="https://github.com/dedunu/imapTest">https://github.com/dedunu/imapTest</a></div>
