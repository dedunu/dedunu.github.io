<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Kindle Fire. WoW. It is an amazing device. I always download e-Books. And theirs no way to read except looking on my monitor. Reading a book on a monitor is not that easy. But the Kindle series made it easier. Easy to read.&nbsp; However, Kindle Fire will change the tablet market. Earlier kindle versions were not very handy because they are not colourful. Now Kindle Fire is an all-in-one internet device.<br /><br />Amazon had mentioned that the Kindle Fire market was very good on Black Friday. But they don't like to show up the numbers. Sooner we can see how Kindle Fire affects other android tabs.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />In 2019,&nbsp; Kindle fire has lost the race. At least as of now. I was wrong :D</div>
