<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I recently installed Alfresco for testing in the vagrant instance. I used the Ubuntu image for the vagrant instance. But I forgot to install all the libraries which are necessary to be installed on Ubuntu before you install alfresco. But fortunately alfresco worked without those dependencies.<br /><br /><a href="http://docs.alfresco.com/5.0/concepts/install-lolibfiles.html">http://docs.alfresco.com/5.0/concepts/install-lolibfiles.html</a><br /><br />Above link gives you what are the libraries you should install before you install Alfresco. You should run below command to install libraries.<br /><pre>sudo apt-get install libice6 libsm6 libxt6 libxrender1 libfontconfig1 libcups2</pre>But still, office document previews didn't work properly. Some documents worked properly but some of them didn't. Then I tried to debug it with one of my colleagues. We found below text in our logs<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/dedunumax/3d748846bc7f6fc6b87e.js"></script> <br />Then we tried to run the soffice application from the terminal. Look what we got!<br /><pre>/home/vagrant/alfresco-5.0.1/libreoffice/program/oosplash: error while loading shared libraries: libXinerama.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory</pre>Then we realised that we should install that library on Ubuntu. Run below command on the Ubuntu server to install the missing library.<br /><br /><pre>sudo apt-get install libxinerama1</pre><br />Make sure you run both commands above! </div>
