<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div align="justify">Today I wanted to paste a few statements on Live Writer which were coded on SQL Server Management Studio 2012. But when I paste the code into Live Writer I got disappointed about the look. Codes were awesome on SMSS 2012 with colours. Then I wanted to find a way to insert those code with Visual Studio formatting. I found a few plugins but they were not cool. Then I found this blog.<br /><br /></div><div align="justify"><a href="http://blog.hoegaerden.be/2010/01/15/windows-live-writer-paste-code-plug-in/">http://blog.hoegaerden.be/2010/01/15/windows-live-writer-paste-code-plug-in/</a></div><div align="justify"><br />He had found a nice plugin. I downloaded that and Installed that. Now I use that. It is a cool plugin.</div><div align="justify"><br /><a href="http://plugins.live.com/writer/detail/paste-from-visual-studio">http://plugins.live.com/writer/detail/paste-from-visual-studio</a></div><div align="justify"><br />Hereâ€™s the link for that plugin.
